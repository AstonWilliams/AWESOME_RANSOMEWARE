# Ransomware python implementation 🔒

![Warning](snap.png)

> **⚠️ Educational Use Only**  
> Simulated ransomware for cybersecurity training. Never deploy maliciously.

## Intro
Python-based ransomware simulation demonstrating:
- AES-256 file encryption/decryption  
- Psychological pressure tactics in ransomware GUIs  
- Basic defensive monitoring  
- Ethical reverse engineering concepts  

## Purpose 🎯
- Train analysts in ransomware behavior analysis  
- Develop defensive pattern recognition  
- Understand encryption mechanisms  
- Practice incident response workflows  

## Usage 🛠️
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install cryptography pillow

# 2. Setup environment
mkdir victim_dir && echo "Test" > victim_dir/test.txt

# 3. Run demo
python ransomware_demo.py

# 4. Monitor with
python ransom_detector.py
```
